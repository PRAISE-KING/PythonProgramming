# control Flow , Control Structures
# it is subdevided into 3 categories
# 1. Sequential Control Flow - Default flow of a program , the program execution is

num1 = int(input("Enter the First Number :"))
num2 = int(input("Enter the Second Number :"))

results = num1 + num2
print("")
print(results)

# Decisional, Selection control flow - the flow of a program is based on condition
# if , if..else , if...elif...else, nested if
# Flowcharts

# 1). if statements

num = 3
if num > 0:
    print(num, "-this is a positive number")
print("Happy Coding")

num = 3
if num > 6:
    print(num, "-this is a positive number")
print("Happy Coding")
# execution is done only if the condition is true

# 2).if...else

num = int(input("Enter the Number :"))

if num >= 0:
    print("this is a positive number")
else:
    print("the number is negative")
